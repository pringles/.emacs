;;; Date: Mar '05
;;; First version: 1987

;;; Author: David Neves, davidneves@hotmail.com

;;; Documentation:
;;; Restore some context from previous editing sessions.
;;; The location of the cursor point is saved (in the file ~/.emacs_context).
;;; Thereafter, whenever a file is read into a buffer you will find 
;;; yourself back at the point where you left off.
;;;
;;; In addition to restoring context of files manually read in there are
;;; three optional user commands:
;;;
;;; 1.  "Meta-x cdired" or "Meta-x context-dired"  It runs DIRED on your
;;; list of context files so that you can easily jump to a file that you
;;; have edited recently.  By default, context for the last 50 files visited is saved.
;;; You can set the default to something else -- see below for context-max-size.
;;; I use this ALL the time.
;;;
;;; 2.  "Meta-x context-restore".  
;;; This restores the context of all files edited (within a 24 hour window).
;;; For example, if during the day you started Emacs 5 times and read in 5 different
;;; files, when you next execute Emacs and do a context-restore all 5 files would be read into Emacs.
;;; If you place "(context-restore)" in your .emacs file then these files will automatically
;;; be read in when emacs starts up.  See below for installation instructions for this.
;;; I almost never use this except when I'm in the middle of editing a lot of files and have to 
;;; reboot or close down my system.  I use cdired above instead.
;;;
;;; 3.  "Meta-x context-filter"
;;; This restores the context of all files filtered by a string you type in.
;;; If you type in a directory (or part of a directory) then all your context files contained
;;; within that directory (or a subdirectory of it) will be read in.
;;; e.g. typing "foodir" as an argument will read in all context files contained within
;;;     ~/foodir.  typing "/" is a way of reading in all your context files.
;;; I've never used this functionality.
;;;
;;; The context is automatically saved when the user exits Emacs.  
;;; The user can also save the context while in Emacs by typing
;;; Meta-x save-context
;;;
;;; see saveplace.el in the emacs distribution for a similar program.
;;;
;;; Easy install:
;;;  1.  Put this file in a directory in load-path
;;;      (or use an absolute pathname for the load in step 2 below,
;;;       e.g., 
;;;      (load "~/context.el") ;or (load "c:/context.el") for Windows
;;;  2.  Put the following 2 lisp expressions in your .emacs file
;;;      (load "context.el")
;;;      (read-context)    ;reads the file context from the context file.
;;;      (context-restore) ;this is optional. It will read in files from the last
;;;                        ;emacs session(s) saved within 24 hours.
;;; Optional installation steps with compilation:
;;;  1.  Byte compile this file (context.el) with
;;;      Meta-x byte-compile-file
;;;  2.  Put the compiled file (context.elc) in a directory in load-path.
;;;      (or use an absolute pathname for the load in step 3 below,
;;;       e.g. (load "~/context.elc")    )
;;;  3.  Put the following 2 lisp expressions in your .emacs file
;;;      (load "context.elc") 
;;;      (read-context)    ;reads the context from the context file.
;;;      (context-restore) ;this is optional. It will read in files from the last
;;;                        ;emacs session(s) saved within 24 hours.
;;;
;;; Changes:
;;; Mar '05 -  Take out expand-file-name in context-filter
;;; Oct '04 -  Change cdired so that files that don't exist or are not currently reachable (i.e.,
;;;            in a shared drive) no longer beep when read into dired.
;;; Oct '03 -  Add def of float-time for earlier version Emacs
;;; Sep '03 -  Gosh, 10 years without changes!
;;;            Rename user commands.
;;;            Add "context-restore" which loads all the files within 24 hours
;;;            Change xxx and rename to "context-filter" to take as an option some
;;;            part of a file or directory name to use as a filter
;;;            to read in.
;;;            FINALLY handle gracefully the cases where one has multiple emacs
;;;            running.  It used to be the case that only context for the last
;;;            emacs exited was kept.  Now all contexts are appended and kept.
;;;            Remove code for version 18 of Emacs and other misc changes.
;;; Oct '93 -  Get CDired to work in version 19.  Take out call to
;;;            reverse in version 19 of cdired.  Take out repeated code
;;;            that somehow snuck in.  Document and fix context-restore.
;;; Oct '93 -  Adapted to Emacs 19 by Johan Vromans - jv@mh.nl (Thanks Johan)
;;;            This file should work in Emacs versions 18 & 19.
;;; Oct '92    Cdired Flags to tcsh are now -fc rather than -f-c
;;; ===
;;; 1988
;;; Mon May  8 handle the tcsh shell. don't read in its .cshrc file.
;;; Fri Sep 23 quote file names for ls in cdired in case they have 
;;;            shell sensitive characters in them.
;;; Thu Sep 15 move RMAIL file check to a check for rmail-mode.
;;;            Context is saved even for files whose point is at
;;;            the beginning so they can be viewed by cdired.
;;; Wed Sep 7  Sys V shells don't like ; to start lines.  Fixed.
;;;            Other misc changes made.
;;; Sun Sep 4  Installed cdired command to run DIRED on context files.
;;; 1987
;;; Wed Nov 25 Don't save context of files/directories in context-ignore-files
;;; Tue Nov 24 reverting a buffer now turns off context
